The goal of `KtFX Commons` is to make JavaFX development with Kotlin more
concise, pleasant, and idiomatic.
It is an explicit goal of this artifact to not add any new features to the
existing JavaFX APIs.

General rules:
 * No instances (class, interface, object, etc.), just extension functions.
 * Class and package names are equal to those in `javafx` package.
